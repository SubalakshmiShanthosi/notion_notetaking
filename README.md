# The Challenge - Building A Notion Clone
Coding Challenges - Build Your Own Notion

For this Coding Challenge we are going to build a clone of the core, essential bits of Notion. To me those are the bits I use daily. Which includes being able to login, create a page / duplicate a page, edit pages and re-oder pages.

**Step Zero**

For this step you’re going to set your environment up, ready to begin developing and testing your solution.

You’re going to be building a backend service, which will need some persistent data store. You’ll also want to build a frontend that uses the backend.

I’m suggesting you build it with separate frontend and backend components so you can experiment with building an API - it’s an opportunity to learn RESTful APIs if you’ve never done it. Or if you’ve done plenty of REST perhaps experiment with gRPC or GraphQL. Have fun learning something new is the safe space that is Coding Challenges!

I’ll leave you to setup your IDE / editor of choice and programming language of choice.
